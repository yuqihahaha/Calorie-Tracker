# Calorie Tracker Project

## Introduction

Knowing the amount of calories to consume is essential to help people reach their fitness goals. Recording food intake 
can help people understand and identify their eating habits, reminding people to stay on track. Therefore, to aid people 
keep a good body health/shape, motivate people (including myself) to lose, gain, or maintain weight, and help people 
continue their efforts, I have chosen to build a calorie tracking and counting application. **Potential users** of this 
application include people who want to maintain good physical health, people who are passionate about fitness, and 
people who want to manage weight. 

<u> Some key features of this application including:</u> 

- Searching caloric content of common foods by categories 
- Adding foods to record page and save (can also delete wrong ones/clear all)
- A button on the record page to calculate Daily Total Calories
- Available for users to set their daily calories goal 
- Comparing the Daily Total Calories with the personal goal 
- displaying *Yayyy! You Made It!* message when the user meets the goal
- displaying the difference between the goal and the actual total when failing to meet the goal
